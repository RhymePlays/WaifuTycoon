## The game is still in the development phase.

### To-Dos
* Make sprites/images that depend on color-modulation be monochrome (or a color that can easily be shifted)
* Make the game more balanced. Do extensive play-testing to figure out how much upgrades should cost, how much eggs should sell for, etc.
